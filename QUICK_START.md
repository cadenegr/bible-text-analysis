Welcome to your Bible Text Analysis project! This guide will help you get started with data analysis.

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your environment is ready with:
- ✅ Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- ✅ All data science packages installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
- ✅ NLTK data downloaded for text analysis
- ✅ Bible text data (King James Version) in `data/raw/`
- ✅ Git repository initialized and connected to GitHub

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

### Step 1: Activate Your Virtual Environment

Every time you work on this project, activate the virtual environment first:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Workspace/bible-text-analysis
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll see `(.venv)` in your terminal when it's activated.

### Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your web browser at `http://localhost:8888`

### Step 3: Start with the Beginner Notebook

Open `notebooks/00_getting_started.ipynb` and follow along! It will teach you:

- ✅ How to load and read text data
- ✅ Count words and find frequencies
- ✅ Create beautiful visualizations
- ✅ Perform basic statistical analysis
- ✅ Search for specific words

## 📊 What Can You Do With This Project?

### Beginner Level:
- Count word frequencies
- Find the most common words
- Analyze word lengths
- Search for specific words (names, themes)
- Create bar charts and histograms

### Intermediate Level:
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative emotions)
- Topic modeling (find themes)
- Compare different books of the Bible
- Analyze vocabulary richness
- Create word clouds

### Advanced Level:
- Machine learning classification
- Named entity recognition
- Network analysis of characters
- Comparative analysis across translations
- Time-series analysis of writing styles

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: `00_getting_started.ipynb` (beginner-friendly)
2. **Next**: `01_data_acquisition.ipynb` (data loading techniques)
3. **Create your own**: Try your own analyses!

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Running Code in Jupyter:
- Press `Shift + Enter` to run a cell
- Press `Esc` then `A` to insert cell above
- Press `Esc` then `B` to insert cell below
- Press `Esc` then `DD` to delete a cell

### Common Commands:
```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Launch JupyterLab (modern interface)
jupyter lab

# Deactivate environment when done
deactivate

# Install new package
pip install package_name

# Update requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Example Analysis Ideas

Try these fun analyses:

1. **Name Analysis**: How many times do names like "Moses", "David", "Paul" appear?
2. **Theme Words**: Compare frequency of "love" vs "fear" vs "faith"
3. **Book Comparison**: Analyze Old Testament vs New Testament vocabulary
4. **Word Length**: Which books use the longest words?
5. **Vocabulary Richness**: Which books use the most unique words?

## 📖 Data Science Concepts You'll Learn

- **Data Loading**: Reading files, handling text
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing punctuation, lowercasing
- **Data Analysis**: Counting, statistics, frequencies
- **Data Visualization**: Charts, graphs, plots
- **Text Processing**: Tokenization, lemmatization
- **Statistical Analysis**: Distributions, correlations

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Jupyter won't start?
```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyter notebook
```

### Package import error?
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Make sure environment is activated
pip install package_name
```

### Can't find the Bible text?
Check that the file exists: `ls -la data/raw/kjv_bible.txt`

## 🌟 Next Steps

1. ✅ Open `00_getting_started.ipynb` and run all cells
2. ✅ Try modifying the code to search for different words
3. ✅ Create your own analysis cells
4. ✅ Save your work: `File > Save and Checkpoint`
5. ✅ Commit changes to Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Completed getting started notebook"
   git push
   ```
